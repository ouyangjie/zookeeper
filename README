该分支是我自己读源代码的心得体会，相关注释参见源代码

#阅读时，注意多重场景：

1）:比如一个新节点加入已经运行多日集群，整个集群及新节点的行为如何？
2）:比如Leader节点Down机，其余节点的表现.
3）:所阅读的代码运行于什么角色中.

zk client 看到的 zk server 的视图(view) 永远是一致的吗？官网说得很清楚:

###Simultaneously Conistent Cross-Client Views###
Simultaneously Consistent Cross-Client Views ZooKeeper does not guarantee that at every instance in time,
two different clients will have identical views of ZooKeeper data. Due to factors like network delays,
one client may perform an update before another client gets notified of the change.
Consider the scenario of two clients, A and B. If client A sets the value of a znode /a from 0 to 1,
then tells client B to read /a, client B may read the old value of 0, depending on which server it is connected to.
If it is important that Client A and Client B read the same value,
Client B should should call the sync() method from the ZooKeeper API method before it performs its read

这跟Zookeeper的"Single System Image"并不矛盾。
